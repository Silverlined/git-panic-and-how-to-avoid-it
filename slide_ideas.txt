Git Panic and how to avoid it

How well do you feel you know git?

Git is hard.

Git Panic symptoms
 We can only use git through GUIs
 Our git workflow is a mess
 Our git history is a mess
 We get a lot of conflicts
 We get blocked by not pushed work
 We lose local changes
 We fix git by cloning to a fresh state
 We lose remote commits

Setting up a repository

 git clone -o "remote_name"

Seeing history
 git log --all --graph --format="%h %d %an %cr %s"
 git log --author="Your Name" --since="3 weeks ago"
 git log master...my-branch --left-right
 git log -p

Adding something specific
  git add -p

Moving our HEAD around
 git reset --hard <commitish>
Warning: deletes changes in the index and working tree
Warning: may lead to orphan commits

Clearing the index
 git reset -p

Unpacking commits
 git reset --soft <commitish>

Where was my HEAD
 git reflog

Checkout the code
 git checkout branch/commit file/folder
 git checkout -b new_branch
 git checkout -p
 git checkout --orphan

A pull is just a fetch and a merge
 git fetch remote branch

Moving commits around
 git cherry-pick <commitish>
 git rebase <target-commitish>
 git rebase -i
